# How-To-Run-Crusader-Kings-Complete-on-Windows-7-8-10-Fix-for-Black-Screen-During-Loading-Chang
A repository for guides for different old games. Considering the game industry quickly evolves, for the purpose of this repository, anything that has been launched more than 5 years ago is considered "old".

In Which Case Should You Use This Guide Edit
Attention!

Try to install and play Crusader Kings Complete first before doing anything in this guide. Some Operating Systems (OS), like recent Windows editions, will prompt you to install Windows DirectPlay which solves the FPS problems addressed in this guide. If this is your case, you will only need to change the resolution, you may skip the FPS section.

INTRODUCTION

If you have  Windows version 8.1 or above, you probably suffer with frame rate issues in Crusader Kings Complete (and also some other old games). I will tell you how to fix this in a simple way. It worked for me and it will work for you. Just for you to know, [b]my guide will make the game playable at 60 fps[/b] for you [b]but the lag experienced when a complete month passes is non-fixable for now[/b] (from what I've read in the game forums, everyone has it). However, there are ways to make this lag manageable and I well show you how as well.

First I will tell you how to fix the frame rate issue. After that, I'll tell you how to make the game playable with as little lag as possible.

Some older games use DirectDraw. Since Windows 8.1, DirectDraw emulation is broken by default. That means we have a hard time playing games that use DirectDraw with a decent fps. But this is easily fixable by downloading a DirectDraw wrapper and placing it in the game files. I'll show you how.

This is a step-to-step guide, just follow the instructions. Don't forget to rate this guide if it helps you.

In order to follow this guide you need two twings:

1. Internet connection
2. WinZip (or any program that does the same)

If you don't have WinZip, [url=https://www.winzip.com/win/en/downwz.html]you can download it here[/url]. You may delete it after doing what's in the guide if you want.

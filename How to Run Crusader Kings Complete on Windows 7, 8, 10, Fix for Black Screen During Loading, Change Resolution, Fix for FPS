In Which Case Should You Use This Guide

Attention!

Try to install and play Crusader Kings Complete first before doing anything in this guide. Some Operating Systems (OS), like recent Windows editions, will prompt you to install Windows DirectPlay which solves the FPS problems addressed in this guide. If this is your case, you will only need to change the resolution, you may skip the FPS section.
